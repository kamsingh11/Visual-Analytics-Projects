#Conclusion

--

- Annual production of plastics increased nearly 200-fold to 381 million tonnes in 2015 

--

- High-income countries generate more plastic waste per person

--

- Poor waste management across many middle- and low-income countries

--

- Improvement of waste management systems across the world to reduce plastic pollution

--

- Looking forward to make it interactive using Shiny to focus on country level detail
